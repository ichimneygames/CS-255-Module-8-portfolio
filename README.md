DriverPass was a client who wanted to create an app to help students further driving knowledge through the use on online programs and the ability to schedule in person driving lessons. They wanted us to design a web based system that allows clients to take the classes anywhere. 

I feel like when it came to understanding the client and the end goal was my strong suit. As in interepting what they were looking for and how long it was going to take. The planning, which showed in the buisness requirements file shows this. 

I would revise my diagrams, when it comes to the actual diagrams, I am still a little confused on what it all asks. It confuses me but I am getting better with these items. I would improve these by looking more at how certian classes interact with eachother and maybe being a little more descriptive in some of these. 

I interpeted the user's needs by taking what they asked and seeing how it would fit within eachother. Kind of like setting all up all the parts before and reading through the instructions once before building the final project. It is important to consider what the user needs because ultimatly it is thier app. They know what they want, we just need to tell them what is realistic and what isn't. 

I apprach designing software by carefully reading my instructions and taking it step by step to make sure that my program is able to fully work within itself. I think I would just use a slower approach to analyze in the future for desinging a system. carefully looking at the big picture and breaking it down. maybe use more diagrams to help.
